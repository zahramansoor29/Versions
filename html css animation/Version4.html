	<h1>The Essence of Normality</h1>

<body id="version4">

		<p id="textbox"> Life is an overwhelming problem for an animal free of instinct. <br>The individual has to protect himself against the world, and he can do this only as any other animal would: by <span class="writing-mode"> narrowing </span> <br> down the world, <div id="shuttingOff" class="animation"><p>shutting off </p></div> experience, developing an obliviousness both to the
		terrors of the world and his own anxieties. Gods can take in the whole of creation because they alone can make sense of it, know what it is all about and for. But as soon as a man lifts his nose from the ground and starts sniffling at eternal problems like life and death, the meaning of a rose or a star cluster- then he is in trouble. Most men spare themselves this trouble by keeping their minds on the small problems of their lives just as their society maps these problems out for them. These are what Kierkegaard called the immediate men, who tranquilize themselves with the trivial, and so they can lead normal lives. <br> <br>

		Right away we can see the immensely fertile horizon that opens up in all of our thinking on mental health and “normal” behavior. In order to function normally, man has to achieve from the beginning a serious construction of the world and of himself. We can say that the essence of normality is the refusal of reality. </p>
