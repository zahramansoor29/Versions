		<p id="textbox"> <em>Life</em> is an overwhelming problem for an animal free of instinct. The individual has to protect himself against the world, and he can do this only as any other animal would: by narrowing down the world, shutting off experience, developing <br>an obliviousness both to the <sub>terrors</sub> of the world and his own <sup>anxieties.</sup> <br>Otherwise he would be crippled for action.<br><br> <b>We</b> cannot repeat too often the great lesson of Freudian psychology: that repression is normal self-protection and creative self-restriction- in a real sense, mans natural substitute for instinct. Rank has a perfect, key term for this natural human talent: he <em>calls</em> it “partialization” and very rightly sees that life is impossible without it. What we call the well-adjusted man has just this capacity to partialize the world for comfortable action. I <b>have</b> used the term “fetishization,” which is exactly the same idea: the <sub>normal</sub> man cited off what he can chew and digest in life, and no more. In other words, men aren’t built to be gods, to take in the whole world; they are built like other creatures, to take in the piece of ground in front of their noses. Gods can take in the whole of creation because they alone can make sense of it, know what it is all about and <em>for</em>. But as soon as a man lifts his nose from the ground and starts sniffling at eternal <b>problems</b> like life and <em>death</em>, the meaning of a rose or a star cluster- then he is in trouble. Most men spare themselves this trouble by keeping their minds on the small problems of their lives just as their society maps these problems out for them. These are what Kierkegaard called the immediate men, who tranquilize themselves with the trivial, and so they can lead normal lives. <br> <br>

		Right away we can see the immensely <sub>fertile</sub> horizon that opens up in all of our thinking on <sup>mental</sup> health and “normal” behavior. In order to function normally, man has to achieve from the beginning a serious construction of the world and of himself. We can say that the essence of normality is the refusal of reality. </p>
