	<h1 id="headline">The Essence of Normality</h1>

	<p id="text">As soon as a man lifts his nose from the ground and starts sniffling at eternal problems like life and death, the 	 meaning of a rose or a star cluster- then he is in trouble. 	Most men spare themselves this trouble by keeping their minds 	 on the small problems of their lives just as their society 	maps these problems out for them. These are what Kierkegaard 	called the immediate men, who tranquilize themselves with the 	 trivial, and so they 	can lead normal lives.

		Right away we can see the immensely fertile horizon that opens up in all of our thinking on mental health and “normal” behavior. In order to function normally, man has to achieve from the beginning a serious construction of the world and of himself. We can say that the essence of normality is the refusal of reality.</p>
